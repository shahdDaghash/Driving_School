# Al-Aqsa Driving_School Project

---
## Why, What 
### Why 
1. Most of the Driving schools in the region we live in use the paper system registration; All transactions are done in paper records and, in best cases are entered manually to an excel worksheet. This applies to Al-Aqsa School. As a solution; a database system is created to turn paperwork into digital and collect all data in one organized data system. 
2. This is the final project for DataBase course ( COMP333 ) in Birzeit University

### What 
-  This system controls the registration process of a student from the moment he/she enters the school until he/she successfully gets the driving license. This process includes paper transactions, driving class scheduling, linking to a specific trainer â€¦ etc.
